I work with Python to build practical tools that automate routine work and connect different services.

### What I do

- Telegram and web-integrated bots (aiogram, APIs, webhooks)  
- Local AI tools with Ollama for privacy-focused workflows  
- Small backend services with FastAPI and integrations

### Tech stack
`Python` · `aiogram` · `FastAPI` · `REST API` · `Ollama` · `PowerShell` · `Windows automation`

### Current focus
Building a clean, minimal set of tools under the Velmora brand and growing my freelance practice (Freelancehunt, Work.ua, LinkedIn).
